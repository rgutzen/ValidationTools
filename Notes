### ToDo ###

+ Improve dist code (graphs)
+ Add Cramer-von-Mises-Test
+ Calculate corrcoef distribution
  and run test down to which mean corrcoef
  assemblies can be identified
+ Shuffle spiketrains before analysis and
  and try to resort them in reasonable groups
  (i.e) in groups whereto the largest eigenvectors point
+ Implement CuBIC
+ Implement oszillations analysis
+ Write function annotations
+ Install and run NEST
+ Create test case with Brunel network
+ Run test validation for different network parameters
> Develop useful to_file function
> Create Jupyter Interface
> Adapt code for collab packages

### ORGANIZATIONAL CONSTRUCT ###

* METHODS

    Distribution Comparisons
    Correlation Matrix
    Oszillations
    Graphs

* IMPLEMENTATION

    Toolbox
        validation  -> dist
                    -> matrix
                    -> test_data
    Jupyter Interface
    => Collab
    => Elephant

* WORKFLOW

    Determine the focus of usage
        z.B:        Neuroscience
                    Deep Learning
                    Simulation
                    Experiment Data

    Test against    Neuron model
                    Spike Loss
                    Time steps
                    Numerical Integration
                    Network Model
                    Reference (given by different architecture/hardware)
                    ...

    Specifiy Test by giving reference/precision/parameters

    Reference:     Brainscales Modelle Comparison
                    Universalreference exact NEST?
                    Create reference by regarding distribution of test results

    Additional measures by user

* USE CASES

    NEST vs SpiNNaker
    Brunel network with different solver/ time step/ precsise
